# Symptom Logger App v2.0

### Update to v2.0
- My application has evolved from a single, large program (version 1.0) into a set of smaller, independent microservices. This change makes the application easier to work on and improve. I built this project as a demonstration of my ability to integrate different components like APIs, a database, and a user interface (Flask server), and how artificial intelligence (AI) can be incorporated into that mix.

The UI I've designed is just one piece of a more extensive application that allows users to describe their health symptoms in their own words. Once a user enters their symptoms, the application uses two different APIs: one to summarize the information and another to create visual charts or graphs of the symptoms.
