# Symptom Logger App v2.0

### Update to v2.0
- Now a collection of microservices rather than a monolith application. This is easier to maintain and develop further.

This UI is part of a larger design for an application to allow users to input symptoms in a free-text format. After logging the symptoms, the application uses two separate APIs: one to summarize the entered data and another to create visual representations of that data.
